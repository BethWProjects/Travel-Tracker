# Travel Tracker

## Abstract
Would you like to track and book your trips in an app you can personalize? Use this repo to help you do just that! This was a solo project assigned by the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/). This was a travel tracking application which utilized a variety of technologies, including javaScript, HTML, CSS, Mocha, and Chai. At the end of this solo project I will have completed 50% of the Turing curriculum, primarily focusing on vanilla JS to this point. The project was completed in 4 days. The project goals were to: implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed, use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation, create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way, write modular, reusable code that follows SRP, implement a robust testing suite using TDD, make network requests to retrieve data, create a user login, and ensure that our app follows best practices for accessability.

## Setup
- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Clone the Local server as well to view client data [Here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
- `cd` into the project
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
- Run `npm start` to launch the live server
- Copy and paste the provided localhost URL into your browser
- Explore and enjoy!

[Webpack starter kit](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/webpack-starter-kit)
[Local Server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)

## Login
1. To login to the dashboard view for a user, please use the current username and password format.

`username: traveler50 (where 50 is the ID of the user, users 1 - 50 should be acccessable)`

`password: travel`

## Testing

There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).

 ## Challenges
- TDD and Class Architecture
- Event Delegation
- Iterating Nested Data 
- Post Calls

## Wins
- API calls
- Dynamic functions created to stick to SRP and get rid of unecessary code
- Accessibility

## Future Extensions
- Implement further error handling
- Implement dynamic features for displaying more trip data to the user, for example, showing all destination images
